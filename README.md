# QuickLyric

QuickLyric is an android app that fetches your lyrics for you almost instantly. Its main perks is that it's very fast, doesn't have ads, features a search engine, the downloading of lyrics on your device and some handy settings. While most lyrics app require you to type the name of the song you're searching for or annoy you with tedious notifications every time the song has changed, QuickLyric automatically detects what song is playing on your device and instantly delivers the lyrics to you. QuickLyric makes use of Google's Material Design.
